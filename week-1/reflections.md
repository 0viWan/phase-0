# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

1)   I was first drawn to the idea of using 'Meditation' to increase productivity primarily because I am a practitioner of yoga and find it nearly synonymous with the intention of meditating.  'Yoga' is a Sanskrit word which can be translated to mean "union", "connection", "application" etc. and is basically a mindful way to increase focus through breath control and physical repetition.  Meditation can be either "Focused Attention"/"Mindful Meditation" (as in yoga) where you are focusing on a point in space, or a sensation such as breathing and allowing yourself to return to focus when the mind wanders.  Conversely it can also be "Open Monitoring" meditation where you focus on everything going on around you without reacting significantly to anything.  When we meditate the brain significantly changes; almost every major part of it responsible for regulating emotions, reasoning, awareness, etc. goes into a "stasis" as Beta Waves decrease.  The resulting lowering of the information we process, and the resulting concentration on a single focus allows us to improve our focus gradually through time.  Meditation loosens the neural connections in the part of the brain responsible for fear/anxiety/stress (Medial Prefrontal Cortex) and strengthens the Assessment Center allowing us the rationalize our view when we are stressed.  Furthermore this art has been studied and believed to raise levels of creativity, compassion, and memory by similar physical and chemical restructuring in the brain.

2)  "Timeboxing" is time management method which allows individuals or groups to compartmentalize tasks at hand into partitioned blocks that have a timed endpoint.  Even if the goal is not met by this agreed upon time, the work goes on hiatus and those involved review what has been done.  In this way, you have a chance to reflect and assess what is accomplished as well as set goals for what needs to be achieved in future, and get a better scope of the timeframe of the project without getting overwhelmed.   I watched the video on a specific timeboxing technique called the "Pomodoro" aptly named after the use of 25-minute kitchen timers to segment work with 5 minute breaks interspersed between.  I see the potential this would have in the Phase 0 process and beyond; tasks that seem daunting are made less fearsome, more efficacious with time, and given more perspective when you are able to break something big down into smaller step-wise functions.  Even when working in pairs or groups during Phase 0 this process could help us organize our thoughts, quickly peer review, and generally keep us on track.

3)   ***I Combined the next four questions above into 1 answer since they all seems to build off each other***:  To be completely honest I do not think I currently have the best time management skills.  Previously the implementation of a guided behavioral plan such as the "Pomodoro Method" were a mere afterthought, but I am receptive to trying it out because time management skills were some of the things I wanted to work on at DBC.  Though I try to schedule things the best I can I find myself scattered when I end of devoting more time to one thing while neglecting the other (ie. Yoga vs. Cooking).  I also know I tend to just "work until done/exhaustion" without taking breaks for review and generally find myself not happy with this tendency.  To combat this I plan to take into consideration two topics I further researched: "Habit Forming" and "Starting Small".  With the former I intend to positively reinforce the implementation of time management techniques with a motivating trigger; setting goals, following through, and responding to the gratification of meeting those expectations (ie. "After I have breakfast I will look review my schedule" or "After I have breakfast I will review my lesson from yesterday").  In this way I can directly see the cause and effect of time management with a more rigid structure.  I also will approach forming good habits in gradation; as Lao Tzu once said: "The journey of 1000 miles begins with a single step"; don't get ahead of myself and build up this practice in steps over time.  In this way, just like the repetition of Yoga, you grow into the comfortability of habit until the effort put into this organization comes as second nature.  This in conjunction with a firm gaze set on abiding by a delineated schedule I keep in an online ledger are the main ways I plan to parcel out my time effectively at DBC.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

A shell is the computer program run by the Unix OS that allows the script to be interpreted in the command line.  The script in the form of commands that are entered in the shell can have varying intended effects such as being to manipulate a file, print out text, or execute a program, etc.  These commands generally provide, convenient and efficient shortcuts to manipulate the processing power of the operating system and computer.  More specifically "Bash" refers to the Unix shell that I am using to enter commands in OS X, and that is widely using by the programming community.  

The most challenging thing in going through this material is just getting used to and comfortable with navigating the language of the shell and realizing the order of operations of it as such.  Learning the jargon of the command line not only involved mindlessly inputing things into the shell; but also referring back and forth between what was entered and then looking at what physically changed in the system in the form of the Graphical User Interface (GUI...ie. when I inputed 'mkdir' did an actual folder appear on my computer?".  Certain commands such as 'cd' have bylaws to their use, such as how to move up properly in a path, so that further added to the initial learning curve of this language. 

I was pretty much able to successfully use all the commands though after repeated attempts for some of them more than others.  Certain commands such as 'pushd' and 'popd' did not come as intuitively to me at first as some of the others, but after analyzing what was going on I now see that it is a way to orient yourself between your current path and other directories you want to  go to.    

That is hard to answer since I have such a novice context for all these commands; I am currently under the impression that I will use all of these commands at some point in my education and beyond, but it does seem that some of these are going to be used way more frequently than others (cd, mkdir, pwd, ls, rmdir, etc.)  I really want to say that they are all of equal importance, as they may used in different measure just depending on what sort of project you are working on.  
pwd - 'print working directory' is essentially a command to orient yourself as to what directory you are currently located at.  Directories or folders have the ability to be shuffled through just as they visually depicted in a GUI.

 ls - ‘list directory’ is the command to print out a list of the contents of the directory that you are currently in.  This is another useful way to orient yourself and decide which directory to proceed to next.

 
mv - ‘move a file or directory’ may be counterintuitive but it is actually the process of renaming a file or directory.  to do so you input: “ mv + old name of the file/directory + the new desired name”.

 
cd - ‘change directory’ is way to navigate between different directories after they have been created.  Just like any road, you must follow the correct tree/path in order to get from point a to b and vice-versa.

 
../ - this is the syntax that should be inputed after cd in order to move up in the tree/path by one partition; if you were trying to move up your path by 3 directories for example you would input: “ cd ../../.. “.

 
touch - is used for creating an empty file of your choosing in whatever directory you are in.  For example inputing “touch newfile.txt” would create a new, empty text file in the present directory.

 
mkdir - ‘make directory’ is the method to create a folder aka. directory that collectively form the path of all your organized input. 

 
less - is way to page through and view the contents of a file (ie. a text file); alternatively if you were to use the ‘more’ command you be given a wider view of the file contents.

 
rmdir - ‘remove directory’ is how to delete a directory that you created.  In order to do so go the directory above the one you desire to rid of and enter: “rmdir + directory name to be deleted”.

 
rm - ‘remove file’ is to do exactly as such.  rm + the file name to be deleted.  Directories can not be deleted until files are removed from them, and this is the input you would use in order to do that.

 
help - ‘man in Unix’ is the way to access the manual that provides a cheatsheet for all the commands listed above and more.

# 1.3 Forking and Cloning Reflection
In order to create a repository you first have to logged into your GitHub account.

Once on your home screen navigate to the top right corner of the screen and next your avatar there should be a plus sign “+” that you can click on to create a new repository. 

On this page next to the ‘owner’ field there is a field where you can designate the name of the repository.  Below that you have the option to provide a description of the repository, setting its status to either ‘public’ (anyone can see the repository but you have the choice of who can commit to it) or ‘private’ (you choose who can see AND commit to it), and add a licensing agreement to it as once. (to review, a ‘commit’ is a collection of actions done to a file in version control that are tracked and submitted at once.  This can be anything altering the state of the file, such as copying, editing, or moving it).  Once done you can click ‘create repository’ to complete the form.

“Forking” is process done on GitHub which allows the user to copy the propriety work of someone else over to your username, thereby delivering a editable version of the work without affecting the original.  This is great assurance for open-source projects that allow individuals to play and experiment with the code without the fear of destroying the source. You now have the option of using, building off of, or altering that code. In order to do this there is a ‘fork’ button on the repository page, which from there you can choose which user you would like to fork the work over to. 

Now that this forked work is in your repository you have the option of cloning it.  Cloning to your computer will give you a local file to work with.  There is a clone URL where you are first able to copy that page’s link. 

After copying this URL go to your command line.  Here you can ‘cd’  (change directory) or ‘mkdir’ (make directory) to the directory of your choosing to place the files of this repository.  Once you are in your desired location type in: git clone followed by the pasted URL from Github. 

After hitting enter you may be prompted for you username and password.  If not you should now have the files cloned over.  You can list the directory (ls) in order to verify you have everything ported over from Github.  Congratulate yourself with a good old pat on the back!

I think my main struggles with getting git and Github setup was with the former, navigating the steps to make sure git was up and running on my computer.  With the later, having never used GitHub before I had to face the learning curve of being introduced to a new interface.  Luckily it is well designed and I am feeling more comfortable toggling with Github and seeing what different things do.  One of the prompts with this course asked for the user to delete the repo they forked over from DBC and fork it over again; I ended up doing some research on what it means to delete in GitHub because there were some scary warnings regarding the deletion of repository in the "settings" field.  I am glad I didn't break anything :-)  Also now having git setup I am feeling way more confident practicing what I have learned regarding the language of the command line; totally useful!
