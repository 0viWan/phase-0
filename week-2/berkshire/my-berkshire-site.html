<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

A) It was rather fun to actually see the fruits of my labor; it's one thing to read about a topic and sort of understand it, but to actually see something you build come into fruition by applying that knowledge is pretty cool...even if that thing is a small 'baby-step' in the journey ahead. That said I am still a little unsure of myself when it comes to "semantic HTML-5" elements...I am not always sure if I am necessarily using the correct jargon as opposed to old versions of HTML.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

I liked the course in Code Academy; I thought it did a good job covering the basics so I was able to implement things like images, div, and span in this exercise. I am still a little confused of how to use the 'section' element of HTML5 that was desribed in bulk in the required-reading article about HTML-5; I opted out of using this for the sake of time, but was able to reach desired results without having to use it.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

I just did as was asked: make a clone of the Berkshire site using what was taught in the HTML lessons and the reading provided. I really don't know a lot about formatting in CSS or HTML for that matter, so I didn't really have a problem about worrying about text placement, etc. I just used the elements asked for in the rubric and the template image of the site that was provided in Canvas to clone it. Maybe if knew more about formatting I would have been tempted to use those elements.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

HTML seems great because of the wide range of versatility it provides, but it also seems a bit tedious at times. It might be because I am not aware of certain shortcuts and abbreviations in the HTML language, but I often found myself repeating myself for things like creating a link. I am sure that the more I read about HTML and practice it in conjunction with CSS my mind will change otherwise.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

My trick for remembering things in HTML is basically just to repeat it over and over again. It is easy to get lost in all the different tags that are out there, but the only real way to have it stick is to actually use those tags. Also it is pretty cool that sublime text automatically reminds you of what you are closing out when you are providing your second set of tags ie. </p>. Also the abbreviations are fairly self-explanatory, such as 'li' representing "list item", 'ol' representing "ordered list" and "ul" representing "unordered list".
