- **_What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?_**

-  Information Gathering: This may be the most critical step in the process because it largely sets the framework for a website/app’s design, honing in on the purpose and end goal a company is ultimately trying to achieve.  During this stage you are analyzing things such as the purpose and goal of the intended site/app, who is person using it, and what kind of content will be provided to better accommodate the user.
-  Planning:  A ‘site map’ is the key element made in this phase. This is a structured map listing out all the content (topics and sub-topics) that will be included in the design. This is integral to the architecture of the site/app as you are forming a clear path your users will eventually navigate when they use your service.  This is also the time to decide what technologies will be incorporated such as a ‘content management system like WordPress.  
-  Design:  Aesthetics! This is when you get to make your app/site look and feel nifty with sensible design choices.  A designer will make prototypes and mockups of what the site/app will ultimately look like keeping in mind factors such as intended audience and the desired identity wish to be portrayed by the company.
-  Development: Now is when the actual website or app is made!  This is done in close collaboration with the designer.  A homepage is made followed by a “shell” for the interior pages. The shell becomes a template for the content pages of the site and provides the route users will ultimately navigate once they can use your service. 
-  Testing and Delivery: The designer will now test out the app/site by making sure all the script is functional and double checking for compatibility issues that might arise, such as viewing discrepancies across web browsers. A good designer will also have a firm grasp of HTML & CSS (front-end design) and make sure the code is up to par with current web standards.  When the site has been perfected, a ‘File Transfer Protocol’ program is used to upload site/app files to a server. If everything is still in working order a designer might also implement plugins if necessary or increase traffic to your site with good SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
-  Maintenance: As things change in time, as should your app/site.  You might want to implement new service, change design, provide new information, etc. so having the ability to alter your creation through a good CMS (Content Management System) may be a good option to have.

- **_What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?_**

-  My site's primary goal and purpose is to introduce myself to the world and possibly pique the interest of employers and potential collaborators on development projects.   My site would feature content largely pertaining to a bio of myself; a profile picture, a summation of who I am as a person, contact info (ie. Google+, GitHub, Twitter, etc.), projects I have worked on or am currently working on, and a link to my blog. 

- **_What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?_**

-  My target audience's interest in finding out more about me as a person, how to get ahold of me, my skillset, background, and even what I look like.  My site would have an easy way to navigate this bio of me that would include my picture, various form of social-media links, concise text expressing who I am as an invidual, and links to examples of my work.  This audience I would image would be the aforementioned potential employers and people who might want to team up and work with me. 

- **_What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors._**

  -  The primary actions I would want users to take when coming to my site would be very simple to view information pertaining to my life/work/career and to give contact information in case they would like to ask, talk, or meet me. Since my visitors are potential clients, employers, or collaborators I would want navigation of my site clean, direct, and very intuitive.  The information provided for my user should be quickly accesible and easy to find.

- **_What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?_**

  -  Design goes hand-in-hand with the development process. It is an integral part in communicating to your users the purpose of your service, the identity of the company providing said service, and to be attractive and engaging with your intended audience. User Experience is the study of how people feel and behave when using a system; this is often coupled with 'usability', which focuses on how user-friendly and efficient an interface is. User Experience varies vastly amongst users and for this reason it can't be measured with tradtional metric tools such 'page views' and 'bounce rates'. Often UX designers have to rely on anecdotal evidence to improve their design. This design also is not 'one size fits all' between different projects and clients. For example, users of the Lyft app may feel very differently when using Uber and vice versa; they may provide a very similar service but might choose one over the other by perceived easy of use, aesthetics, and liking towards the interface. 

- **_What is user experience design and why is it valuable?_**

-  Simply put, 'user experience' is how the design of a website or app makes a user feel. They are design elements that focus largely on what the user ultimately wants as opposed to the designer or company hosting the site/app. It is such a valuable component of the development process because no matter what is being developed, the goal at hand often lies with attracting, engaging, and retaining your users: if a user feels good about using your app/site that person will likely remain a user. 

- **_Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?_**

  I didn't find anything in this challenge incredibly tedious. There was one site that we were required to peruse that detailed the increased need for UX resarch that did admittedly have a lot of information. That being said I find UX/UI fascinating stuff so I rather enjoyed reading a lot of this. When I have more time I would most likely do more reading on the subject. I didn't think creating a map of my website was tedious either because I like the process of visually frameworking your intended creation.  I think it's a great way to keep your intention organized and clear.
