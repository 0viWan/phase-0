**_What is a wireframe?_**

-  A wireframe is essentially the blueprint  for the visual design and intended flow of a website or app.  It is a ‘bare skeleton’ of the final end-product, and has visual cues for the content that will eventually inhabit the working, live page or app.  Before developers can get down to the details of a project, they have to map out what content will be provided and how users will eventually process the information hierarchy of their build; What are we showing, telling, selling, etc? How do we want users to navigate? What are important links, buttons, images, videos, search fields, etc. that we might want to include?  A wireframe is a key benchmark in a designer being able to establish interaction design (UI) and how users will feel (UX).


**_What are the benefits of wireframing?_**

-  Wireframing is important because it gives the designer an overarching view of the build of the website/app without being encumbered by graphics, script, typeface, etc. Just like in the build of a home you first need a solid foundation before you can worry about the fixtures and paint; in a parallel way a site/app must have a strong core understanding of it’s intention and flow before text and aesthetics are applied with languages such as HTML and CSS.  This stage is very edit-friendly and allows you to quickly remap your design as you implement or throw out ideas in necessary for your particular goals. By the time one gets to coding, you will already have a formula for what needs to be written. Awesome!


**_Did you enjoy wireframing your site?_**

-  I really did enjoy wireframing my site; UI/UX are fields that really interest me and I am a person who likes clean, intuitive, artistic and appropriate design. That said I think time-boxing was a good suggestion for this exercise. I can see how it is easy to get carried away with design choices and overvaluing aesthetics over the user’s experience in processing the information hierarchy that is presented to them. 


**_Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?_**

-  I did revise my wireframe. I had an idea that I originally used that it turns out I wasn’t keen on. I scrapped it and looked to a friend’s blog I liked as inspiration. I really started to know how on this particular blog everything flowed together seamlessly, and the overall look of it was not overwrought with design elements; overall I wanted a clean look in my wireframe design as well.


**_What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?_**

-  The first question I asked when I approached this challenge was: Where do I begin?; it seemed there were almost limitless tools in order to wireframe and I wasn’t sure which option would be best for my particular needs. In the end I choose GoMockingbird because it has a ‘free’ option, and is really easy to use without virtually any technical know-how.  I also asked: “What are the things I want included in my site?”. This included elements such as profile picture, social media profiles, contact, blog, resume, and bio.  “How do I want the information to flow?”: I wanted text links at the top near the header that lead to their respective areas in the body of the frame. Some of those links might also lead to further pages, such as my ‘blog’ section. 


**_Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?_**

-  As I previously stated I enjoyed the process of actually designing the site because UI/UX are fields that interest me. I have never done design work but could see myself wanting to learn more about it in the future. I also liked reading the article about UX and its ubiquity in the modern development process. I did find that having to peruse the different wireframing platforms was a bit tedious because there are just so many different options. I wasn't sure which was one going to be the best for my needs so I had to demo a couple of them before I finally settled on GoMockingbird.
